## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 **1. End-to-End ELT Pipeline with dbt + Snowflake**
**Tech:** dbt, Snowflake, Airflow, Python  
- Built a production-grade ELT pipeline with modularized dbt models (staging → core → marts).  
- Implemented tests, documentation, macros, and performance optimizations.  
- Automated scheduled runs using Airflow with lineage visibility.

---

### 🔹 **2. Streaming Ingestion Pipeline using Kafka + Databricks**
**Tech:** Kafka, Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake  
- Processed high-volume event data in near real-time.  
- Implemented schema enforcement, checkpointing, and incremental writes.  
- Enabled downstream analysts to access curated Delta tables.

---

### 🔹 **3. Automated Data Quality Framework**
**Tech:** Python, dbt tests, Great Expectations 
- Built reusable rules for null checks, primary keys, uniqueness, and referential integrity.  
- Integrated rules into the CI/CD pipeline to block bad deployments.

---

### 🔹 **4. Healthcare Claims Analytics Model**
**Tech:** SQL, Python, Airflow, Snowflake  
- Designed a claims data model for eligibility, pharmacy, CPT/ICD grouping, and utilization metrics.  
- Improved reporting accuracy and refresh time for analytics teams.

---

## 📈 What I'm Currently Learning
- Advanced **data observability** techniques  
- **Large-scale streaming patterns** with Kafka / Spark  
- Optimizing **warehouse compute costs** in Snowflake and BigQuery  
- ML feature engineering pipelines (for MLOps alignment)
